You will be able to peer into the workings of your circuits to better understand them. Difficult problems will suddenly become trivial. We tried many beginner oscilloscopes and found this one to be a perfect balance of price and function for anyone looking to to examine signals lower than 50MHz and in need of 4 channels.  At this price, it's perfect as a 'first scope' or as a hacker-space resource to share - and can be used for years as your projects get more complicated.`;
